<h2>Plot 1</h2>
<p>
Description: Plot 1 shows the number of license records per year. You can see how the counts rise or fall across time.

Design Choices: I use a bar chart. Year is on the x axis. Count is on the y axis. This structure supports quick reading.

Color Choices: I use one color. The plot only tracks totals. Extra color does not add value.

Transformations: I convert LastModifiedDate to a date. I extract the year. I drop missing rows. I keep a smaller sample to avoid large data issues.
</p>

<div id="plot1"></div>
<script>
vegaEmbed('#plot1', 'plot1.json');
</script>

<h2>Plot 2</h2>
<p>
Description: Plot 2 shows license counts per year grouped by license type. This highlights differences across categories.

Design Choices: I use a bar chart. Year is on the x axis. Count is on the y axis. License Type controls color so each group stands out.

Color Choices: I map each license type to a color. This helps to compare groups.

Transformations: I use the same cleaned data as Plot 1. Year is already extracted, so no extra steps are needed.

vegaEmbed('#plot2', 'plot2.json');

<h2>Interactivity</h2>
<p>
The second plot uses tooltips. You can see the year, license type, and count when you hover on a bar. This makes the plot easier to read.
