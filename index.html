<h2>Plot 1</h2>
<p>
Description: Plot 1 shows the number of license records per year. You can see how the counts rise or fall across time.
</p>

<p>
Design Choices: I use a bar chart. Year is on the x axis. Count is on the y axis. This structure supports quick reading.
</p>

<p>
Color Choices: I use one color. The plot only tracks totals. Extra color does not add value.
</p>

<p>
Transformations: I convert LastModifiedDate to a date. I extract the year and drop missing rows. I keep a smaller sample to avoid large data issues.
</p>

<div id="plot1"></div>
<script>
vegaEmbed('#plot1', 'plot1.json');
</script>

<h2>Plot 2</h2>
<p>
Description: Plot 2 shows license counts per year grouped by license type. This highlights differences across categories.
</p>

<p>
Design Choices: I use a bar chart. Year is on the x axis. Count is on the y axis. Each license type has its own color so the groups stand out clearly.
</p>

<p>
Color Choices: I map each license type to a color. This helps to compare groups.
</p>

<p>
Transformations: This plot uses the same cleaned dataset from Plot 1. The year is already extracted, so no further steps are needed.
</p>

<div id="plot2"></div> 
<script>
vegaEmbed('#plot2', 'plot2.json');
</script>

<h2>Interactivity</h2>
<p>
The second plot uses tooltips. You can see the year, license type, and count when you hover on the bar. This makes the plot easier to read.
